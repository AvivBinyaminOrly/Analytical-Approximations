# Analytical Approximations of Special Functions

## Overview

This repository accompanies the paper titled [Analytical Approximations as Close as Desired to Special Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11947). It presents the code for all the analytical approximations and shows their relative accuracy compared to their corresponding numerical calculations.

All code is available as an online Wolfram notebook at [https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/3208909](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/3208909).

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide uniform analytical expressions that approximate functions over their entire range. These approximations are crafted to mirror the original function as accurately as desired while having features that the original function lacks. This approach is particularly useful for functions defined by integrals or infinite series that do not have closed-form expressions.
