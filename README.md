# Analytical Approximations of Special Functions

## Overview

This repository accompanies the paper titled [Analytical approximations as close as desired to special functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11947).

It includes the code for the cosmological functions approximations and shows their values corresponding to the original calculations.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide uniform analytical expressions that approximate a function over its entire range. These approximations are crafted to mirror the original function as accurately as desired while having features that the original function lacks. This approach is particularly useful for functions defined by integrals or infinite series that do not have closed-form expressions.
